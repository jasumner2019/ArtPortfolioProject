Welcome to the Gallery!

In this project, I attempted to create an online gallery where a user can peruse selections of art,
and, sometime down the road, even purchase prints and NFTs through this site. While I originally intended 
to use my own works, I realized that I was posting this gallery in public code, and therefore 
deigned not to use my own images for the meantime, though I do intend on using my own work when I 
eventually host my project.

Some of the key features are as follows: a main page showing a basic carousel, a Gallery showing a list of art pieces
and a brief description of each. Also (not available now but will be in the future), I'll have each of those art pieces
link to its own display page where will be written a full story about the inspiration and the creative process
of each piece. There will also be a link to the Shop for each piece's full story. There is also an About Me page 
describing a little bit about me and why I do art, and then there's a Contact page where anyone can reach out. There's
also a Shop page which, in the future, will have links so users can purchase prints of my works, as well as 
a link-out NFT button in the nav bar which will link to my NFT shop.

I started by creating a basic wireframe of the project, which I stuck to pretty faithfully during implementation.
One modification I made to the original idea was to add in a "Subscribe to the Newsletter" section in the Contact 
page, which I added remembering that an artist's greatest asset is the mailing list. I created a main navigation 
bar, as well as a simple footer with an instagram link (which I have yet to improve and perfect), but on top of that,
there is no need for any fancy modals or that such.

If you'd like to see some screenshots, I invite you to explore the "screenshot_images" folder.

I learned a ton from this project, not the least of which was how to construct my own website, and how to make
a website responsive based on the type of device which happens to view it. I would say that the site's best and
worst feature is its simplicity, as I wasn't able to "show off" as other students were able to, but at the same time,
this project didn't need "showing off" of my technical skills, but the very existence of a gallery is to "show off"
the art itself.

I'm very excited about what I've learned, especially knowing that I could use this site as my own foundation to 
start a personal art gallery, and potentially make a business from it. In hindsight, I might have chosen to make
two columns in the gallery so I could display more art at once, which I may do, but for now I like the way it looks.
